Wolf3D

This projectâ€™s goal is to follow the footsteps of the brillant programmerJohn Carmack to write a personal version of Wolfenstein 3D.
The goal is not to re-write not the entire Wolfenstein 3D, but a 3D representation of a maze in which a player can findhis/her way
using the ray casting technique.

__NOTE:__
The whole project was realized using the graphic library: SDL2.
Only basic drawing functions of the library are authorized : open a window, lit a pixel and manage events.
Everything else has to be coded by students (ex. pixel coloring, map reader, rotations, vector library...).
Users can customize the map through a file like this one: ...

__Mandatory options:__
- Size and the shape of the labyrinth editable via file
- EST key and red cross on the Window must quit the program cleanly
- Movements with arrow keys like the in the original game
- Different wall textures depending of compass point (North, South, East, West).

__Bonus options:__
- Wall collisions
- Floor texture
- Sky (Color Gradient)
- Items in the maze
- Collectible items

For this project I decided to make all files public but please do not hesitate to contact me if need additional details.
